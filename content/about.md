Software Engineer at Billups with a passion for building maintainable and performant web services with Go.
I'm also a mentor for the Pigmice, my old high school FIRST robotics team. I think high school robotics is
one of the greatest things any high schooler can do for their future. I help [Brian Mock](https://mockbrian.com/)
out with organizing the [Portland Keyboard Club](https://pdxkbc.com/), and love designing and building keyboards.
My other hobbies outside of programming, FRC, and keyboards, would be working on my car, skiing, and listening to music.
