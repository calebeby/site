# Work Experience

**Billups**, *Software Engineer* (May 2019 - *present*)

* Developed a Go reverse proxy for authorization which allowed us to remove lots of complexity from existing services, create new services faster, and secure third party APIs in a seamless way, additionally, replaced a friction-causing custom express server with a proper API gateway
* Improved platform performance through agressive caching and code-splitting, decreased load time significantly
* Continued to maintain existing Go and Python services interacting with PostgreSQL/MariaDB/ElasticSearch/Redis databases as well as other internal and external services for the DSP (Demand-Side Platform), continued to participate in regular code review
* Began working on new CRUD services in Go for the new Supply-Side Platform
* Maintained and setup new infrastructure with terraform, cloudformation, and ansible
* Transitioned our services from ECS to EKS (using Rancher to manage clusters)

**Billups**, *Engineering Intern* (July 2018 - May 2019)

* Added features to and provided bug fixes for existing Go and Python micro-services for our Demand-Side Platform, participated regularly in code review
* Developed a new Go service for a core Demand-Side Platform feature that involved communicating with multiple internal services, authenticating via OAuth2, and interacting with SQL databases.
* Reverse engineered many APIs/websites and developed a long-running Go service to scrape huge amounts of data, de-duplicate, and store in PostgreSQL/S3

# Projects

* [Peregrine](/2018/10/peregrine/), a web app for reporting and analyzing performance of robots in FIRST Robotics Competitions with a Go and PostgreSQL [backend](https://github.com/Pigmice2733/peregrine-backend) deployed on Digital Ocean Managed Kubernetes, and a Preact [frontend](https://github.com/Pigmice2733/peregrine-frontend) hosted on Netlfiy when I was in high school
* Programmed a robot in Java/Python to compete in FIRST Robotics Competitions year to year when I was in high school
* [slamd](https://github.com/fharding1/slamd), a split 40% ortholinear mechanical keyboard I designed
* [pdxkbc-badge](https://github.com/fharding1/pdxkbc-badge), a badge for DEF CON representing the Portland Keyboard Club (of which I am an organizer)
* [gemux](https://github.com/fharding1/gemux), [pwnedpass](https://github.com/fharding1/pwnedpass), and many other open-source projects on my Github
* Have contributed features to [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), [mrparkers/terraform-keycloak-provider](https://github.com/mrparkers/terraform-provider-keycloak), and other open source projects.
