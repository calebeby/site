# Work Experience

**Billups**, *Software Engineer* (May 2019 - *present*)

* Developed a Go reverse proxy for authorization which allowed us to remove lots of complexity from existing services, create new services faster, and secure third party APIs in a seamless way
* Replaced a complex and friction-causing custom express server in the DSP (Demand-Side Platform) frontend codebase with a proper API gateway, allowed us to serve our frontend using any basic static web host
* Improved platform performance through agressive caching and code-splitting, cut 1s off load-time
* Continued to maintain existing Go and Python services for the DSP, continued to participate in regular code review
* Began working on new Go services for the new Supply-Side Platform
* Created a new Go service for generating client proposals (powerpoints), saved media planners hundreds of hours
* Maintained and setup new infrastructure with terraform, cloudformation, and ansible

**Billups**, *Engineering Intern* (July 2018 - May 2019)

* Added features and provided bug fixes for existing Go and Python services for our demand-side platform, participated regularly in code review
* Developed a new Go service for a core DSP (Demand-Side Platform) feature that involved communicating with multiple internal services and a SQL database
* Reverse engineered many APIs/websites and developed a long-running Go service to scrape data from them, de-duplicate, and store in S3
