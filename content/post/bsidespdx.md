I'll be at [BSidesPDX](https://bsidespdx.org/) this weekend, for my second
year. I'm going to be participating on the sectribe capture-the-flag team with
@swordofomen, and some other infosec peeps. I'm gonna focus on web exploits,
reverse engineering, and possibly take a crack at the OSINT section. I'm also
looking forward to the [Hardware Implant
Panel](https://bsidespdx.org/events/2018/speakers.html#hwimplant) talk, given by Kim
Zetter, Joe Grand, Joe FitzPatrick, @\_\_MG\_\_, @r00tkillah, Mickey Shkatov and
Jason Meltzer.
