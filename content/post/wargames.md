One of my favorite scenes from WarGames is after Joshua guesses the launch code
and then decides "the winning move is not to play". I decided to make a fun Go
program that guesses the launch code and then interacts with the user as
Falken does in the movie. You can find it
[here](https://github.com/fharding1/wargames). I think the way it simulates
guessing the launch code is actually really great as it's very similar looking
to the movie. There's a goroutine for each character of the launch code.
